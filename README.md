# Employee Management System

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The **Employee Management System** is a web application that allows administrators to assign tasks to employees and enables employees to view and manage their tasks. This system is designed to simplify task management, improve communication, and provide a seamless experience for both admins and employees through a role-based dashboard system.

## ✨ Features

- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Depending on login credentials, users are directed to the Admin or Employee dashboard.
- **Task Assignment**: Admins can create tasks by filling in details like task title, due date, priority, category, and description.
- **Task Management**: Employees can log in, view assigned tasks, accept them, and track their status (New, Active, Completed, or Failed).
- **Real-Time Updates**: Task statuses are dynamically updated using React’s Context API.
- **Persistent Data**: Task and user information is stored in localStorage for easy retrieval.
- **Clean and Responsive UI**: Built using **Tailwind CSS** for a mobile-friendly and attractive interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Context API**: For managing global state
- **localStorage**: For persistent storage of task and user data
